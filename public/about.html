<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello! I’m an enthusiastic and detail-driven web developer with a passion for building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I love turning ideas into functional, beautiful digital experiences using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React. With a strong eye for design and a love for problem-solving, I enjoy creating websites that are not only technically solid but also thoughtfully crafted and enjoyable to use.</p>
 
  <p>I’m always eager to learn new tools, improve my skills, and collaborate on projects that make a real impact. Whether it’s developing from scratch or improving existing code, I bring positive energy, creativity, and a genuine love for web development into everything I do.</p>


  <h3>Let’s build something amazing together!</h3>
